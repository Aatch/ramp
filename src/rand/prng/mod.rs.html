<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! First it has to be said most PRNGs are very fast, and will rarely be a</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! performance bottleneck.</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! Performance of basic PRNGs is a bit of a subtle thing. It depends a lot on</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! the CPU architecture (32 vs. 64 bits), inlining, and also on the number of</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! available registers. This often causes the performance to be affected by</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! surrounding code due to inlining and other usage of registers.</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! When choosing a PRNG for performance it is important to benchmark your own</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! application due to interactions between PRNGs and surrounding code and</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! dependence on the CPU architecture as well as the impact of the size of</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! data requested. Because of all this, we do not include performance numbers</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! here but merely a qualitative rating.</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! CSPRNGs are a little different in that they typically generate a block of</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! output in a cache, and pull outputs from the cache. This allows them to have</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! good amortised performance, and reduces or completely removes the influence</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! of surrounding code on the CSPRNG performance.</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! ### Worst-case performance</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! Because CSPRNGs usually produce a block of values into a cache, they have</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! poor worst case performance (in contrast to basic PRNGs, where the</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! performance is usually quite regular).</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! ## State size</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! Simple PRNGs often use very little memory, commonly only a few words, where</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! a *word* is usually either `u32` or `u64`. This is not true for all</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! non-cryptographic PRNGs however, for example the historically popular</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! Mersenne Twister MT19937 algorithm requires 2.5 kB of state.</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! CSPRNGs typically require more memory; since the seed size is recommended</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! to be at least 192 bits and some more may be required for the algorithm,</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! 256 bits would be approximately the minimum secure size. In practice,</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! CSPRNGs tend to use quite a bit more, [`ChaChaRng`] is relatively small with</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! 136 bytes of state.</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! </span>
<span class="doccomment">//! ## Initialization time</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! The time required to initialize new generators varies significantly. Many</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! simple PRNGs and even some cryptographic ones (including [`ChaChaRng`])</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! only need to copy the seed value and some constants into their state, and</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! thus can be constructed very quickly. In contrast, CSPRNGs with large state</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! require an expensive key-expansion.</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! # Quality</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! Many basic PRNGs are not much more than a couple of bitwise and arithmetic</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! operations. Their simplicity gives good performance, but also means there</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! are small regularities hidden in the generated random number stream.</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! How much do those hidden regularities matter? That is hard to say, and</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! depends on how the RNG gets used. If there happen to be correlations between</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! the random numbers and the algorithm they are used in, the results can be</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! wrong or misleading.</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! A random number generator can be considered good if it gives the correct</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! results in as many applications as possible. The quality of PRNG</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! algorithms can be evaluated to some extend analytically, to determine the</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! cycle length and to rule out some correlations. Then there are empirical</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! test suites designed to test how well a PRNG performs on a wide range of</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! possible uses, the latest and most complete of which are [TestU01] and</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! [PractRand].</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! CSPRNGs tend to be more complex, and have an explicit requirement to be</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! unpredictable. This implies there must be no obvious correlations between</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! output values.</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! ### Quality stars:</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! PRNGs with 3 stars or more should be good enough for any purpose.</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! 1 or 2 stars may be good enough for typical apps and games, but do not work</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! well with all algorithms.</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! ## Period</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! The *period* or *cycle length* of a PRNG is the number of values that can be</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! generated after which it starts repeating the same random number stream.</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! Many PRNGs have a fixed-size period, but for some only an expected average</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! cycle length can be given, where the exact length depends on the seed.</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! On today&#39;s hardware, even a fast RNG with a cycle length of *only*</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! 2&lt;sup&gt;64&lt;/sup&gt; can be used for centuries before cycling. Yet we recommend a</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! period of 2&lt;sup&gt;128&lt;/sup&gt; or more, which most modern PRNGs satisfy.</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! Alternatively a PRNG with shorter period but support for multiple streams</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! may be chosen. There are two reasons for this, as follows.</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! If we see the entire period of an RNG as one long random number stream,</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! every independently seeded RNG returns a slice of that stream. When multiple</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! RNG are seeded randomly, there is an increasingly large chance to end up</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! with a partially overlapping slice of the stream.</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! If the period of the RNG is 2&lt;sup&gt;128&lt;/sup&gt;, and an application consumes</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! 2&lt;sup&gt;48&lt;/sup&gt; values, it then takes about 2&lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt; random</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! initializations to have a chance of 1 in a million to repeat part of an</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! already used stream. This seems good enough for common usage of</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! non-cryptographic generators, hence the recommendation of at least</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! 2&lt;sup&gt;128&lt;/sup&gt;. As an estimate, the chance of any overlap in a period of</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! size `p` with `n` independent seeds and `u` values used per seed is</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! approximately `1 - e^(-u * n^2 / (2 * p))`.</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! Further, it is not recommended to use the full period of an RNG. Many</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! PRNGs have a property called *k-dimensional equidistribution*, meaning that</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! for values of some size (potentially larger than the output size), all</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! possible values are produced the same number of times over the generator&#39;s</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! period. This is not a property of true randomness. This is known as the</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! generalized birthday problem, see the [PCG paper] for a good explanation.</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! This results in a noticable bias on output after generating more values</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! than the square root of the period (after 2&lt;sup&gt;64&lt;/sup&gt; values for a</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! period of 2&lt;sup&gt;128&lt;/sup&gt;).</span>

<span class="doccomment">//! # Security</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! ## Predictability</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! From the context of any PRNG, one can ask the question *given some previous</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! output from the PRNG, is it possible to predict the next output value?*</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! This is an important property in any situation where there might be an</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! adversary.</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! Regular PRNGs tend to be predictable, although with varying difficulty. In</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! some cases prediction is trivial, for example plain Xorshift outputs part of</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! its state without mutation, and prediction is as simple as seeding a new</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! Xorshift generator from four `u32` outputs. Other generators, like</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! [PCG](http://www.pcg-random.org/predictability.html) and truncated Xorshift*</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! are harder to predict, but not outside the realm of common mathematics and a</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! desktop PC.</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! The basic security that CSPRNGs must provide is the infeasibility to predict</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! output. This requirement is formalized as the [next-bit test]; this is</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! roughly stated as: given the first *k* bits of a random sequence, the</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! sequence satisfies the next-bit test if there is no algorithm able to</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! predict the next bit using reasonable computing power.</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! A further security that *some* CSPRNGs provide is forward secrecy:</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! in the event that the CSPRNGs state is revealed at some point, it must be</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! infeasible to reconstruct previous states or output. Note that many CSPRNGs</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! *do not* have forward secrecy in their usual formulations.</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! As an outsider it is hard to get a good idea about the security of an</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! algorithm. People in the field of cryptography spend a lot of effort</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! analyzing existing designs, and what was once considered good may now turn</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! out to be weaker. Generally it is best to use algorithms well-analyzed by</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! experts, such as those recommended by NIST or ECRYPT.</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! ## State and seeding</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! It is worth noting that a CSPRNG&#39;s security relies absolutely on being</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! seeded with a secure random key. Should the key be known or guessable, all</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! output of the CSPRNG is easy to guess. This implies that the seed should</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! come from a trusted source; usually either the OS or another CSPRNG. Our</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! seeding helper trait, [`FromEntropy`], and the source it uses</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! ([`EntropyRng`]), should be secure. Additionally, [`ThreadRng`] is a CSPRNG,</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! thus it is acceptable to seed from this (although for security applications</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! fresh/external entropy should be preferred).</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! Further, it should be obvious that the internal state of a CSPRNG must be</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! kept secret. With that in mind, our implementations do not provide direct</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! access to most of their internal state, and `Debug` implementations do not</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! print any internal state. This does not fully protect CSPRNG state; code</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! within the same process may read this memory (and we allow cloning and</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! serialisation of CSPRNGs for convenience). Further, a running process may be</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! forked by the operating system, which may leave both processes with a copy</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! of the same generator.</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! ## Not a crypto library</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! It should be emphasised that this is not a cryptography library; although</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! Rand does take some measures to provide secure random numbers, it does not</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! necessarily take all recommended measures. Further, cryptographic processes</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! such as encryption and authentication are complex and must be implemented</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! very carefully to avoid flaws and resist known attacks. It is therefore</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! recommended to use specialized libraries where possible, for example</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! [openssl], [ring] and the [RustCrypto libraries].</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! # Extra features</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! Some PRNGs may provide extra features, like:</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! - Support for multiple streams, which can help with parallel tasks.</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! - The ability to jump or seek around in the random number stream;</span>
